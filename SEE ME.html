          I made this game to help people open up â€” gently, honestly, and without pressure.<br><br>
          
          Sometimes we donâ€™t know how to talk about the things that matter. We want to connect, but weâ€™re afraid to start.  
          <em>See Me</em> is meant to be that starting point â€” a slow, safe path into vulnerability, whether youâ€™re with a friend, a partner, or just taking a quiet moment with yourself.<br><br>
          
          I created this for everyone, but also for a specific group close to my heart: pilots.  
          In aviation, weâ€™re trained to stay composed, solve problems, and push through â€” but weâ€™re not always given space to talk about what weâ€™re feeling.  
          My hope is that this game gives pilots (and those who care about them) a way to connect, reflect, and be human with each other â€” beyond the cockpit.<br><br>
          
          <strong>Every purchase of See Me helps fund a bigger goal:</strong><br>
          Weâ€™re working to provide a shared training aircraft for student pilots â€” giving them more access, opportunity, and support in their journey.<br><br>
          
          Thank you for being here. Thank you for seeing others. And thank you for helping someone take flight.
